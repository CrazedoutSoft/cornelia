<h2>Why jGazm?</h2>

Java is a very powerful coding language but has a very high setup/startup overhead.
When wanting to use the Java language for smaller or temporary assignments it's is a pain to go through the
boilerplate coding of setting up a class and static void main etc. Then you have to compile the source and run the
class separately. What if there was a way to execute Java code directly without the hassle of creating the class overhead.<p>
<b>jGazm</b> is created for tht soul purpose to execute Java code on the fly, right of the bat without a IDE or java/javac.
It can also be used to create batch files or other scripting jobs as file parsing, FTP/HTTP downloads, instant database access and so on...
<p>
<h2>Running jGazm programs without jGazm</h2>
By using the command line option <i><b>-export</b></i> all the class files, resources, classpaths etc, will be exported and packed in a executable jar file.
This means the you can distribute you jGazm program as a standard Java program with ease.
<pre><code>
>jgazm -stdin -export:C:\\myexport\\MyApp.jar
alert("Hello from pure Java");
.
Exported to:C:\myexport\MyApp.jar
